# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents working in this project. This is the cross-tool
entry point. Codex, Google Antigravity, and OpenCode read `AGENTS.md`. Other
compatible tools do too. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`, which imports this file,
so there is a single source of truth.

Claude Code, Codex, and every other AI tool must not add AI attribution to
commits or pull requests, including AI `Co-Authored-By` trailers or generated-by
signatures. Preserve genuine human attribution. See
[Commit and PR attribution](blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md#commit-and-pr-attribution)
for optional tool settings.

## What this is

ai-portfolio-assistant is a Next.js app.

> TODO: describe the project and the problem it solves once
> `blueprint/project-plan.md` is filled in.

This project is built with the **AI Blueprint**, a workflow layer, not an
app skeleton. To start a new project, scaffold the app first in an empty folder
(create-next-app, Vite, etc.), then overlay these files on top. Never run a
framework scaffolder inside a directory that already holds the blueprint files
(`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `blueprint/`); it fails
because the directory isn't empty.

The workflow is defined by the local skills and context files below.

## Proportional engineering

Build for established requirements, not hypothetical scale, threats, or future
flexibility. Reuse existing code, the standard library, native platform features,
and installed dependencies before adding machinery.

- Unknown scale or extensibility defaults to the smaller reversible design. Do
  not infer enterprise, multi-tenant, hostile-user, or compliance requirements.
- Derive trust and data-integrity boundaries from actual reachability: untrusted
  input, auth/session/ownership, shared persisted data, destructive operations,
  payments, secrets, and sensitive data.
- Ask only when an unknown materially changes behavior, architecture, persisted
  data, interoperability, a real security boundary, or cost. Otherwise choose the
  simplest repository-native implementation.
- Add an abstraction, dependency, service, configuration surface, compatibility
  layer, or security mechanism only for a current requirement.
- Simplicity never removes real trust-boundary validation, data-loss prevention,
  accessibility, explicit security requirements, configured tests, or project rules.
- Stack-specific template standards apply only when the project uses that stack.

## Read these when relevant

- `blueprint/config.json` - deterministic project workflow settings
- `blueprint/workflow.md` - workflow reference for configuration, skills, dashboard activity, and checks
- `blueprint/context/project-overview.md` - the project's source of truth
- `blueprint/context/coding-standards.md` - read before changing code
- `blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md` - read when running the Blueprint workflow
- `blueprint/context/current-feature.md` - the one feature, fix, or rollback being built in this checkout

Reuse relevant context already loaded in the session. Claude Code imports only
this file; its Blueprint skills load the other files on demand.

## Workflow

Build one feature, fix, or rollback at a time, behind review gates. The feature
loop is `/feature` -> `/implement` -> `/check` -> `/audit current` ->
`/complete`; approve the Feature spec before Implement. Each command is a local
skill at `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` or `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`
that carries its own instructions. Claude Code and Google Antigravity use slash
commands such as `/feature`, Codex uses `$feature`, and other tools can follow
the matching `SKILL.md` when asked.

Skills: `adopt`, `audit`, `blueprint-doctor`, `blueprint-status`, `brief`,
`check`, `ci`, `complete`, `debug`, `discovery`, `explore`, `feature`, `fix`,
`implement`, `onboard`, `overview`, `prototype`, `release`, `rollback`, and
`tests`, plus the explicit-only `autopilot` and `continuous`.

- Keep one active work item per checkout. Parallel work needs its own clone or
  Git worktree and branch; never replace another worker's active spec.
- `blueprint/config.json` can make review or verification stricter and tune
  local workflow settings. It never grants permission to commit, merge, push,
  deploy, publish, send, delete data, waive a failing check, or accept a finding.
- Never create or edit `blueprint/.state/run.json` directly. Tracked skills
  record dashboard activity through the managed helper.

## Commands

- Dev server: `npm run dev` (http://localhost:3000)
- Build: `npm run build`
- Production server: `npm run start` (after a build)
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- CV import: `npm run import:cv -- path/to/cv.docx` (or `.pdf`) drafts `content/cv.md` for review
- Portfolio import: `npm run import:portfolio` fetches the live portfolio site and drafts `content/portfolio.md` for review

No test, typecheck, or Verify command is configured, so tests are not a gate yet.

Testing is opt-in. If this project does not already have a unit test runner, run
`/tests` or `$tests` to add one and update this section with the real test
commands.

Browser testing is also opt-in. Run `/tests browser` or `$tests browser` to add
or normalize a browser harness and document its exact command as `Browser
tests`. Check and Continuous Mode can then reuse it without installing tooling
mid-feature.

## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
